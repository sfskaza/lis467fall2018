      <h1>
        This is my Title (h1)

      <h2>
        This is my first section (h2)
      </h2>
      <p>
        I only made minore changes to my HTML document, and I barely changed the content or words written because they are unimportant. Most of my changes took place in my CSS.  In my HTML I basically just added a "Title" element, and spaced my entire body within a "div" element so that I could create borders/<strong>margins</strong> for the page to make it look a bit nicer.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I am just writing words.  This is a random paragraph.  You can stop reading here.  I am not saying anything.  This is just to test/see what my paragraphs will look like.  I hope they indent properly, but it might not.  Let's see, shall we?  Do you think here is a good place to make a new paragraph?  Do you think I've written enough that it will go on multiple lines instead of just one line?  I think so.  I hope so.  Fingers crossed!  Let's try.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is my second paragraph.  I want to make sure this indents, too.  And I want to see what two paragraphs might look like together.  Again, you do not have to read this.  This is all junk.  I might as well be writing gibberish.  I think this is enough.  I'm going to stop writing here.  I hope I don't have to add more later...

      <h3>
        This is my second section (h3)

        I will include links here:
      </p>  
        <ul>
          <li>This should link to<a href="www.simmons.edu" target="_blank">Simmons University's</a> website. (it should open in a new tab...)</li>
          <li>This should link to the<a href="www.bostonglobe.com" target="_blank">Boston Globe</a> (this should also open in a new tab.)</li>
          <li>Here is the link to my own <a href="https://lis467fall2018-skaza799840.codeanyapp.com/Lab2/lab2.html">HTML page</a> (i.e. the one you're currently viewing in some form).  This one will <strong>not</strong> open in a new tab.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        Here is a random picture just for fun and to see what it looks like and what I can do with it.
