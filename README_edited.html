  <h1>
    This is my Title (h1)
  </h1>
  <h2>
    This is my first section (h2)
  </h2>
  <p>
    I am just writing words.  This is a random paragraph.  You can stop reading here.  I am not saying anything.  This is just to test/see what my paragraphs will look like.  I hope they indent properly, but it might not.  Let's see, shall we?  Do you think here is a good place to make a new paragraph?  Do you think I've written enough that it will go on multiple lines instead of just one line?  I think so.  I hope so.  Fingers crossed!  Let's try.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is my second paragraph.  I want to make sure this indents, too.  And I want to see what two paragraphs might look like together.  Again, you do not have to read this.  This is all junk.  I might as well be writing gibberish.  I think this is enough.  I'm going to stop writing here.  I hope I don't have to add more later...

  <h3>
    This is my second section (h3)
  </h3>
  <p>
    I will include links here:
  </p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>This should link to<a href="www.simmons.edu" target="_blank">Simmons University's</a> website. (it should open in a new tab...)</li>
      <li>This should link to the<a href="www.bostonglobe.com" target="_blank">Boston Globe</a> (this should also open in a new tab.)</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
<p>
  Here is a random picture just for fun and to see what it looks like and what I can do with it.
